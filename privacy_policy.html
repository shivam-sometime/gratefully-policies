<h4>Privacy Policy for Gratefully</h4>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025 </p>
<p><strong>Gratefully â€“ Gratitude Journal</strong><br>
    Developed by <strong>SatvikInfoByte Technologies</strong></p>

<h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. All your entries and data are stored locally on your device and remain fully under your control.</p>
<p>We use third-party services, including Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics, to collect and analyze usage data, performance issues, and app crashes. This may include anonymized device data, app usage patterns, and crash reports.</p>
<p>This information is used solely to improve the appâ€™s stability, performance, and user experience. It helps us identify bugs, crashes, and understand how users interact with the app features.</p>

<h4>2. Google Drive Backup</h4>
<p>Gratefully offers an optional Google Drive backup feature to help users save and restore their journal entries. When you enable this feature, the app requests your permission to access your Google Drive account. Your data is only stored in your personal Google Drive and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
<p>You are in full control of your backups and can delete them from your Google Drive at any time. We do not have access to your Google Drive files.</p>

<h4>3. In-App Purchases</h4>
<p>Some features, such as Google Drive backup, may require a one-time purchase or subscription through Google Playâ€™s in-app billing system. We do not collect or store any payment information. All transactions are securely handled by Google Play, in accordance with their policies.</p>

<h4>4. Internet Access</h4>
<p>While most features of Gratefully work offline, the Google Drive backup and in-app purchase features require an internet connection. Other than these optional features, the app does not communicate with external servers.</p>

<h4>5. Data Sharing</h4>
<p>Some data is processed by Googleâ€™s Firebase services in accordance with their Privacy Policy. We do not sell or share personal information with any unauthorized parties.</p>

<h4>6. Security</h4>
<p>Since all primary data is stored on your device, we recommend using your device's security features (e.g., PIN, fingerprint) to keep your entries safe. For Google Drive backups, security is managed by your Google account and its associated protections.</p>

<h4>7. Policy Changes</h4>
<p>This privacy policy may be updated if the appâ€™s features change in the future. Users will be informed of such updates via the app.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this policy, contact us at:<br>
